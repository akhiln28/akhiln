This is a simple static website for my blog. I am using github pages for hosting these files. I didn't use any framework or static site generator for creating the site content. I just used plain html for creating the site content. I used tailwindcss for styling the content. This involves a little bit of manual work, but I am ok with that. I have a lot of creative freedom in that I can use whatever library I want with very little impact on other files.
