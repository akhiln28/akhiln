    I want to share my learning with everyone. This will help me reflect on my learning and also help others who are interested in doing the same thing as me. 
  </p>

  <p>
    With lot of time and effort, I realized some very important things (mistakes) during my journey. I realized that I didn't reflect/understand enough on the things that I was using to build software. I spent most of the time watching tutorials, reading books, and completing courses. I didn't spend enough time building things. I didn't realize that I was not learning anything new. I didn't realize that I was procrastinating.
