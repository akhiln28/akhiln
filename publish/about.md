# About me

Hello! I am Akhil, a software engineer from Hyderabad/India. Here are some of my interests:

1. CS & Math
2. Programming languages
3. Web
4. HomeLab
5. How to guides (mostly for my future self)
6. Data structures and algorithms
7. Operating system and Networking

I want to share my learning with everyone. This will help me reflect on my learning and also help others who are interested in doing the same thing as me.

With lot of time and effort, I realized some very important things (mistakes) during my journey. I realized that I didn't reflect/understand enough on the things that I was using to build software. I spent most of the time watching tutorials, reading books, and completing courses. I didn't spend enough time building things. I didn't realize that I was not learning anything new. I didn't realize that I was procrastinating.

I will be sharing the following things in this website:

- **Guides:** step by step instructions to setup project/environment etc.
- **Blog:** my thoughts on various topics/technologies/concepts.
