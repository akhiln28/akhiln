  <h1>Is async rust worth it?</h1>
  <p>
    I have been using rust for a while now, and I starting to think that async rust might not be needed. Atleast, I think the drawbacks of using async rust outweigh the benefits. I am not sure if I am missing something, but I think that the async rust is not worth it.
