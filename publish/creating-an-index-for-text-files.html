    <h1>Creating an Index for text content</h1>
    <p>
      There are many instances where you might want to search text content in your project. But often times we use
      a tool that does much more than what is required. Might be easier to get started with, but when you need a
      feature that is not already present, it is very difficult to implement it in the existing tool which already
      does so many things. Most of the times it seems like a black box to you.

    <p>
      Sometimes, it is better to use tiny or small dependencies or build your own from scratch. This way, you will
      have more control over it and you can change it to suit your needs.
