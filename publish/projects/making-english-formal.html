<p>
  We all know the power of LLMs (large language models) to generate the next sequence of tokens that are very human like, thanks to the power of transformers and enormous amount of gpu compute required to train them. Training an llm is out of reach for consumer grade GPUs.

  But what if we can make the english language formal so that we can define it as a context free grammar?
</blockquote>
