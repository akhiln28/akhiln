          <li>For custom webcomponent, we don't need to worry about styling the component by not using shadow dom. The main purpose of shadow dom is to isolate the elements in shadow dom so that they don't inherit the styling from the main dom. Now, I don't have any reason to use react.</li>

          <li>Started working on math equation js project. Realized that firefox has much better support for mathml compared to chrome. There are few things not working in chrome when display is set to block, the fractions are rendered in out of proportion.</li>
