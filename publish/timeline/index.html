          Created a simple parser for math expressions/equations in rust. The parser is able to create a struct for the expression in rust. Compiled it to wasm using cargo with target wasm32-unknown-unknown. But having a hard time using it in the browser. I am able to use it with <code>wasm_bindgen</code> crate, but I don't want to abstract away the wasm binary with dependencies. I want to use the wasm binary directly in the browser. <a href="../projects/math-equation-js.html">Math equation</a>

          Got an idea to make English language formal. The idea is to define the English language as a context free grammar. This way, generating the next sequence of tokens will be easy for training a language model. <a href="../projects/making-english-formal.html">Making English Language Formal</a>

          <li>For custom webcomponent, we don't need to worry about styling the component by not using shadow dom. The main purpose of shadow dom is to isolate the elements in shadow dom so that they don't inherit the styling from the main dom. Now, I don't have any reason to use react.</li>

          <li>Started working on math equation js project. Realized that firefox has much better support for mathml compared to chrome. There are few things not working in chrome when display is set to block, the fractions are rendered in out of proportion.</li>
