    <h1>Web components over frameworks</h1>
    <blockquote>
        The main motivation for using the frontend frameworks like react and others is to be able to create modular
        components that can be used (reused) together to create a new component.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        To elaborate what I mean by that let's say your website has a navigation header, footer and sidebar. You
        need to include the html for them in each and every html page of your website. The only way to do this
        earlier is to copy paste the same html code in each and every html page. This is much harder to maintain.
    <p>
    <p>
        There is no way to do that before without using frontend frameworks earlier. But now, with the introduction
        of web components, you can create such reusable components without any frameworks or additional tooling.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Browser can't understand react code.</li>
        <li>We can't write a react application without using node.</li>
        <li>React and such frameworks don't respect the html semantics. This might result in less accessible web
            pages.</li>
        <li>There is a lot of additional tooling required to use react like node, npm, webpack, babel, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    I agree that html might not be nice to write or look at, but it has all the semantics that a browser can
    understand.
    <p>
        In this context, the less dependencies you have, the easier it is to maintain your code, the easier it is to
        make changes, the easier it is to port it to another project and so on, the easier it is to later switch to
        another dependencies.
    </p>
    <blockquote> You will have freedom.
    </blockquote>
    Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML
    tags to use in web pages and web apps.

    <p>
        The hard part of development is not to write the code, but to maintain it. Once you realize that
        creating web components is not that much different compared to creating class components in react, you will
        see that you can create a lot of reusable components that can be used in any project.
